# java-demo

This repository contains several examples of code I wrote throughout the years. It is chronologically ordered and in each file, there are several comments about mistakes I made and possible improvements. The code is not executable, it serves for demonstration purposes.

- 1 - First project in java.
- 2,3 - Modules used in my Bachelor thesis, part of the gamified information system made for Gamifika. The system used microservices architecture.
- 4 - First module designed purely by me, while working at Gamifika. Stories is part of the library module.

- 6 - Mission progression logic. Part of the entire game logic of the gamified information system.
